# 🧭 Mobile Robot Simulation with CoppeliaSim and ROS 2

This repository provides a **CoppeliaSim–ROS 2 integration workspace** for mobile robot simulation and control.  
It includes both **low-level perception and control nodes** (e.g. LIDAR-based navigation) and **high-level logic** (e.g. finite state machine coordination).

## 📚 Introductory Material

Before running this project, it is strongly recommended to go through:

- **ROS 2 Basics:**  
  [https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html)

- **CoppeliaSim + ROS 2 Integration Tutorial:**  
  [https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/helpFiles/en/ros2Tutorial.htm](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/helpFiles/en/ros2Tutorial.htm)

These tutorials explain how to connect ROS 2 nodes with CoppeliaSim via topics, services, and transforms.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

This project is organized as a standard **ROS 2 colcon workspace**:

```
mobile_robot_ws/
├── src/
│   ├── follow_pkg/          # LIDAR-based reactive navigation
│   └── high_level_control/  # Finite-state machine (FSM) for mission control
└── README.md
```

---

## ⚙️ Build and Source Instructions

1. Navigate to the workspace root:
   ```bash
   cd ~/mobile_robot_ws
   ```

2. Build the workspace:
   ```bash
   colcon build
   ```

3. Source the setup file before running any node:
   ```bash
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

---

## 🚀 Running the Simulation

1. Start **CoppeliaSim**, open the provided `.ttt` scene, and run the simulation.  
2. In a terminal (after sourcing the workspace), launch your ROS 2 nodes:
   ```bash
   ros2 run follow_pkg follow_node
   ros2 run high_level_control fsm_node
   ```

- The **`follow_pkg`** package handles reactive navigation and obstacle avoidance using LIDAR data.  
- The **`high_level_control`** package manages mission-level logic through a finite state machine.
